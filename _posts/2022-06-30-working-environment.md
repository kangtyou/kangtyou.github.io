## A working envrionment

For a good working envrionment, you need to have the following requirement:
1. First to keep a good body, you need to keep excercise, have a good diet and sleep
2. Second you need to have a very good facility, like the laptop, the monitor, the notebook and pen, and importantly **a corfortable chair with back surport**
3. Quit or mostly only smoke one cigareete one day and don't masturbate too much, because you will suffer for this however.
