I used to use other voice to mute my inner voice, to make myself silent inside and endure more to do the boring things. Which is a kind of lying myself, actually your drive and your doing will eventually make you the power of growth.

## Silence is a terrible thing, but with suitable material, you can generate great work

A smart person will have a lot of thing to talk or ideas to share. But if the environment kill their drive, the friends, the dull and misearable thing delay their intelligent pluses, they will become a noraml one, even worse, because they are not satisefied with everything, they are lying on the ground with eyes upon to the sky but helpless.
