I used to use other voice to mute my inner voice, to make myself silent inside and endure more to do the boring things. Which is a kind of lying myself, actually your drive and your doing will eventually make you the power of growth.

## Silence is a terrible thing, but with suitable material, you can generate great work

A smart person will have a lot of thing to talk or ideas to share. But if the environment kill their drive, the friends, the dull and misearable thing delay their intelligent pluses, they will become a noraml one, even worse, because they are not satisefied with everything, they are lying on the ground with eyes upon to the sky but helpless.

## Accept the pure self and face it

Although every person need to read books or perceive information to enlarge our view about this world. But remember one thing, **we are here in this world distill information not swollow information**. We should respect our brain, let it think with their own power, judge without biasis. Stop thinking all the bad emotion that comes from our brain are bad. Actually you need to face yourself more authenticly, accept the pure yourself, and keep or care your brain condition.
