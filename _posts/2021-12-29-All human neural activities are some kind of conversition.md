The most enjoyable thing in the world is immersed into a never ending conversation, cause that way we can constantly feel a fullfill joyment arise from our heart botttom.

We have learned that neural system is built from neural cells, and the basic function of a neural cell, is the reflextion reaction. We give a input and then the cell give us a output, it's very like a conversation, you speak to me, and then I make a response to you.

The reason why human differ from other animals is that we are intelligent enough, we can speak langauge. And then what is really called a langauge, here I would say, It's a mechanism that can encode and ensemble many low level information into a high level abstract form and make them be comuntable. Just give you guys a example, if I say apple, this word, what your language brain do is let all the vision, touch, smell ,taste info, gathered together into one word, which is apple.

Summrize all, all human neural activities can be think as a conversation, you do something, and then it rewards back. Differences varries from who are speaking, who are responding, and how much you enjoyed from that.

Some hindsite from the theory, if you even don't know how to maintain a conversation with others, with youself, how could you have a very happy life.
